# Cardcutter
This is a tool for importing print-and-play PDFs into Probability.
It slices up PDFs using a grid, and creates a zip file you can import.

Try it here: https://garbo-succus.github.io/cardcutter/

If you find this useful, have suggestions, or problems using it,
please let us know on the #cardcutter [Discord](https://discord.gg/sJVbJcd) channel.

## TODO 

* Add guide on how to import that zip into probability
* Add guide on how to combine multiple export zips
* It would be better if you could draw grids on the page, and save/open the config/grids as a file
